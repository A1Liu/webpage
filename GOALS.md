# Goals
What is this project for? Ordered list, where top means more important.

#### Fun
I'd like to have fun. If this project isn't fun, I shouldn't be working on it.

#### Convenience
I'd like a homepage that organizes the things I use most often, as well as a place that can act as a library of references that I've found over time.

#### Diversification of Work
I'd like to work on a personal project that doesn't involve things that I usually work with -- I spent a lot of time in the past few weeks using python and java to do math, and I think it's unhealthy to continuously do the same work over and over. Hopefully this project will be a respite from that aspect of computer science.

#### Practice
I'd like to learn javascript, HTML, and CSS, at the very least to have a broader skill set. More importantly though, UI design is something I'm super uncomfortable with, and this is an opportunity to change that.

#### Self Advertisement
I'd like to be able to demonstrate what I know to future employers.
